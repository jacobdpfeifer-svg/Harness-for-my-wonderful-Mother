"""Guesty -> local schema sync.

Replaces the CSV/iCal bootstrap as the system of record. Three passes:

  listings     -> properties        (identity, floors/ceilings seeded from Guesty prices)
  calendar     -> nightly_inventory (nightly price, status, min-stay)
  reservations -> booked_price      (what actually converted, for the ceiling)

The calendar carries the LISTED price for every night including booked ones, but a
listed price on a booked night is not what the guest paid. Booked prices are therefore
taken from reservations (fareAccommodation / nights) and written over the calendar's
number, because the ceiling model is explicitly built on realised prices.
